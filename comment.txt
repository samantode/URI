I have heard the video recording

As per my understanding,

1. Prospects will be created in pardot and will be synced in salesforce
3. Prospects will have parent accounts
3. We have to update trigger 'LeadRoutingTrigger'
4. When a lead is created in saleforce, we will find its parent account
5. We will check its type
	a. If type = Client, no owner is displyed on page, we have to get userId from field called 
	   'credentialing sales executive',and assign lead to that user
	b. If type = Prospect,account owner is displayed on page, 
       Lead is to be assigned to userIds in field
			a. Contract lifecycle sales executive
			b. Credentialating sales executive
			c. Supply chain sales executive
	c. It there is no type/or lead does not have an account 
		Assign lead to general queue
		
An automated email is to be send to the Sales person that lead owner has been changed.

6. Acounts are created manually, we dont have to handle account creation

7. We have to query for account by Account/Organizaion name 

8. To avoid hardcoding, we need to create an object with lookup fields for user and region.
   Please let me where we are going to use this object.
   Because for retrieving user id to assign lead,we will query on its parent account.
   
9. And we will have to use GiHub.

Please let me know, If I have interpreted the things correctly and correct me if I am wrong.
Also send me credentials so that I can strat working on the same.
